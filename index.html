                  <p class="two">The aim is to optimize the ability to run a healthy golf club in Denmark. The mean is to optimize both the club members’ and guests’ experiences when visiting golf clubs and in doing so increasing their loyalty and making them into club ambassadors.</p>
                  <p class="two ge">The Players 1st program consists of two parts, equally important. Firstly, there is a data collection system, that presents knowledge and results in a tailor-made online-dashboard. Secondly, there is a training program that teaches the clubs to turn the obtained knowledge and results into everyday actions.</p>
